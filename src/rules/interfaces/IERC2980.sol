 * @title IERC2980
 * @notice Interface for ERC-2980 Swiss Compliant Asset Token whitelist and frozenlist getters.
 * @dev
 * Implements the mandatory `ERC2980` interface from https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-2980.
 *
 * Deviation from the ERC-2980 `Whitelistable` and `Freezable` example interfaces:
 * The spec's single-address management functions (`addAddressToWhitelist`, `removeAddressFromWhitelist`,
 * `addAddressToFrozenlist`, `removeAddressFromFrozenlist`) return a `bool` indicating whether the
 * operation changed state and do NOT revert on duplicates or missing entries.
 * This implementation uses a different naming convention and instead reverts on invalid
 * single-item operations (duplicate add or missing remove), consistent with the codebase convention.
 * Batch operations remain non-reverting as per convention.
